# Thought Process involved in attempting the ML_SIG assignments


## Cory Schafer Videos
* Had learnt Python from LPTHW, so first 20 videos were a cake-walk.
* Installed anaconda
* Completed the videos

## Python assignments
* Assignments Given. Most of them were already available on the net. Attempted at first, then cross-checked with popular versions on  net. My implementations are not fool-proof. Incomplete - some of them.
* Yet to attempt those involving GUI (tkinter). Working on the tkinter alarm app for [Python_SIG](https://github.com/siddhantkhandelwal/Python-Scripts)

## Cleaning Tweets
* Browsed on the web, read about the topic - apparently, is a very crucial step in NLP, feels similar to making a cross on the top face of the cube.
* Attempting the walkthrough [tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/clean-text-machine-learning-python/)
* Created a conda environment with python3.6
* Using nltk now.
* Make a rough sketch of the requirements, their order of processing and then implement them. Helps.
* Used Hunspell for Spell-check.

## Andrew Ng ML Course (Coursera)
* Already completed till Week 2.
* Installed Octave.
* Have to decide upon how will I be going ahead with the course assignments.
  * Went ahead with Python. Found a repository with python based assignments replica from the Andrew NG course. See [important-sources.md](https://github.com/siddhantkhandelwal/ML_SIG/blob/master/important-sources.md)
* Doing assignments in Python! (See [README.md](https://github.com/siddhantkhandelwal/ML_SIG/blob/master/README.md) for links to solutions)
* Don't stress much on mastering numpy, pandas, matplotlib; you can learn along as well.

## [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) ML Specialisation Courses
* The first in the set of courses revisits NN. Will help in getting a good grip. (Watch in 2x)
* The second course, on hyperparameter tuning was fun and gave deeper insight into handling a ML Project. Introduction to Tensorflow
* The third course taught the structuring of a ML Project.
* The fourth course, CNNs is very interesting.
