#Thought Process involved in attempting the ML_SIG assignments


##Cory Schafer Videos
* Had learnt Python from LPTHW, so first 20 videos were a cake-walk.
* Installed anaconda

##Python assignments
* Assignments Given. Most of them were already available on the net. Attempted at first, then cross-checked with popular versions on  net. My implementations are not fool-proof. Incomplete - some of them.
* Yet to attempt those involving GUI

##Cleaning Tweets
* Browsed on the web, read about the topic - apparently, is a very crucial step in NLP, feels similar to making a cross on the top face of the cube.
* Attempting the walkthrough tutorial at "https://machinelearningmastery.com/clean-text-machine-learning-python/"
* Created a conda environment with python3.6
* Using nltk now.
